# AMSBIB package

The amsbib.sty package is intended for bibliography in LaTeX2e using AMS-TeX commands. 
Using these commands allows you to avoid explicit markup of the list of literature (explicit allocation of various elements by using different fonts, punctuation, brackets, etc.) which is inevitable while reworking the files when preparing manuscripts for printing.
It also automatically creates hyperlinks in the list of literature. 
In addition, if you want to change the way you design a bibliography, instead of explicitly fixing all the markup throughout the article (or even in several articles), simply change the style file. 
The amsbib.sty package contains the bibliographic design commands adapted to the LaTeX2e format from the amsppt.sty style file, plus some additional commands that extend the dialing capabilities and facilitate the design of hyperlinks.

Style design of the amsbib.sty package corresponds to the style adopted in the leading journals of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
